Dudley rushed at Embiid with 7:42 remaining in the third quarter and Brooklyn leading 67-61 after the Sixers center fouled Jarrett Allen near the basket, bringing the 6-foot-11 Allen to the floor. In the ensuing fracas, Dudley and Ben Simmons spilled into the courtside seats along the baseline at Barclays Center. After play was stopped for several minutes to sort out the penalties, Embiid was assessed a flagrant foul 1, and both Dudley and Butler -- who swung his left forearm at Dudley -- were called for technical fouls and ejected from the game. Despite the loss of Butler, the Sixers rallied to outscore the Nets 51-41 the rest of the way and took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. In Game 2, Embiid elbowed Allen in the face, drawing a flagrant foul 1 after an officials' review. Afterward, Embiid chuckled during his postgame news conference while apologizing for the play. After later seeing the replay, Embiid admitted he should have been ejected.<br><b>Article top words: </b>Dudley Embiid -- both Allen <br>&nbsp;<br><b>News number: </b>2<br><b>Headline: </b>2019 NBA playoffs: Matchups, schedules, news and more <br><b>Link: </b>http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26483864/2019-nba-playoffs-matchups-schedules-news-more<br><b>Article text: </b> The NBA's second season is underway!

Malone had resisted making any changes to the starting lineup in the first three games, sticking with the struggling Barton. But Barton missed 12 of 13 3-pointers in the first three games of Denver's first-round NBA playoff series with the San Antonio Spurs, and Spurs point guard Derrick White entered Game 4 on a tear. White was averaging 23 points and shooting 69 percent after scoring a career-high 36 points in the Spurs' Game 3 victory Thursday, which left San Antonio with a 2-1 series lead. Craig gives Malone another defensive option to potentially slow down White. But more than anything, Malone is hoping his starting lineup will get off to a better start by defending and rebounding early in Game 4. "Talking about regular season, the team that won the first quarter won every meeting," Malone said before Saturday's game. "And we're also 0-3 in that area. I'm tired of playing from behind. I'm tired of playing catch-up. My hope would be that we can find a way to get the defense going early." Craig provided the Nuggets with a spark off the bench in Game 3, scoring 12 points, grabbing six rebounds and playing tough defense. Over the past two days, Malone pleaded with his team to be more aggressive and take the fight to the Spurs. "The rebounding will speak volumes," Malone said, when asked how he will know if his team heeds his message. "And the ability to guard the paint. In Game 1, we looked like a bunch of ticket takers, take a ticket, come right in. And that can't be the case." Malone also said he wants to see more emotion from his team, particularly Jamal Murray, who has struggled outside of scoring 21 points in the fourth quarter of the Nuggets' Game 2 win. "Jamal is one of those guys that plays his best when he has emotion," Malone said. "I didn't see any emotion in Game 3. He played a very flat game ... emotion, how engaged are you? Are you ready to participate in the fight? I want to see some emotion, see some fire, see some passion. And we have to sustain that."<br><b>Article top words: </b>Malone Game starting Craig points <br>&nbsp;<br><b>News number: </b>4<br><b>Headline: </b>Sixers' Embiid returns to start Game 4 vs. Nets <br><b>Link: </b>http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26567359/sixers-embiid-returns-start-game-4-vs-nets<br><b>Article text: </b> Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid started Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday after being listed as doubtful with soreness in his left knee. Embiid, who missed 14 of the Sixers' 24 games after the All-Star break, sat out a 131-115 win in Game 3 as the Sixers took a 2-1 series lead. The Sixers announced Embiid was playing Saturday approximately 15 minutes before tipoff. His last-minute playing-status announcements have caused Nets coach Kenny Atkinson consternation. "We find out their starting lineup with about five minutes to go," Atkinson said before Game 4. "I don't know, but somehow we got to figure that one out as media, league." In retaliation, Atkinson did not divulge his Game 4 starters -- Jared Dudley and Caris LeVert replaced DeMarre Carroll and Rodions Kurucs in the first unit -- as early as he usually does. "Normally I'd give it [with] 60 [minutes remaining] on the clock [before tipoff], but I'm not going to do that again," Atkinson said. Embiid was limited to 45 combined minutes between the first two games of the series, which Philadelphia split 1-1 on its home floor, and the All-Star big man was a late scratch for Game 3 after finishing a warm-up about 30 minutes prior to tipoff. On Friday, after launching some casual 3-pointers while wearing slippers, Embiid laced up his sneakers and worked with a team trainer and assistant coach Monty Williams on a side court during the portion of practice that was available to the media.<br><b>Article top words: </b>Game Embiid was minutes Atkinson <br>&nbsp;<br><b>News number: </b>5<br><b>Headline: </b>Source: Croatian F Samanic enters NBA draft <br><b>Link: </b>http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26566925/source-croatian-f-samanic-enters-nba-draft<br><b>Article text: </b> Croatian forward Luka Samanic has submitted paperwork to the league office to make himself eligible for the 2019 NBA draft, a source told ESPN. Samanic, the No. 39 prospect in the ESPN Top 100, plays for Olimpija Ljubljana in the Adriatic, Slovenian and FIBA Champions leagues, averaging 7.5 points and 4.5 rebounds in 18 minutes through 44 games. Samanic was named the MVP of the FIBA U18 European Championship Division B in 2017. Measured over 6-foot-11 in shoes at last year's Basketball Without Borders Global Camp in Los Angeles during All-Star Weekend, Samanic is a skilled perimeter player with impressive fluidity for a player his size. He's proven capable of guarding a variety of positions defensively throughout his career, although he will need to add strength to his lanky frame and continue to improve his consistency as a shooter. Samanic's size, versatility and youth, at just 19 years old, will give him a chance to potentially hear his name called in the first round should he elect to stay in at the June 10 early-entry deadline.<br><b>Article top words: </b>Samanic FIBA player  Croatian <br>&nbsp;<br><b>News number: </b>6<br><b>Headline: </b>Georgian prospect Bitadze enters NBA draft <br><b>Link: </b>http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26564973/georgian-prospect-bitadze-enters-nba-draft<br><b>Article text: </b> Georgian center Goga Bitadze has submitted paperwork to the league office to make himself eligible for the 2019 NBA draft, his agent Misko Raznatovic told ESPN. Bitadze, the No. 19 prospect in the ESPN Top 100, is having an outstanding season in the Euroleague for Buducnost, averaging 12.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in 24 minutes while shooting 60 percent from inside the arc, something that's never been accomplished by a teenager in Euroleague history. He is the runaway favorite to win the prestigious Euroleague Rising Star award which will be announced at the final four in May. He posted the highest PER in Euroleague history for a teenager, exceeding that of Luka Doncic's last season. The 7-foot, 250 pound Bitadze was discovered as a 16-year old at the FIBA U16 European Championship, and was quickly signed by Serbian agency Beobasket, who run Adriatic League farm team Mega Bemax. The Belgrad-based club has sent numerous players, including Nikola Jokic, to the NBA over the years. Bitadze was having one of the most dominant campaigns in Adriatic League history for a teenager at 20 points 8 rebounds in 28 minutes per game when he received an offer in late December to be loaned from Mega to Euroleague club Buducnost from neighboring Montenegro, which he accepted. Bitadze is currently playing in the Adriatic League playoff finals, attempting to help the team secure a spot in next season's Euroleague. He will return to Mega Leks for the Serbian League, which runs through May and early June, at the conclusion of the series. Bitadze has represented his native country of the Republic of Georgia in every age category at the FIBA level, including the U16, U18 and U20s. He played all ten games of the FIBA World Cup Qualifiers with the senior team as well until his Euroleague obligations forced him to decline a call-up for its February window. Bitadze has a case to be considered the top center prospect in the draft thanks to excellent size, girth, and versatile skill level offensively, as he's equally comfortable operating inside the post, on the perimeter or as a finisher in pick and roll situations. His limitations as a defender and overall declining value of big men in today's NBA may hold those aspirations back some, but there are a number of teams that consider him a lottery-caliber prospect nonetheless. No Georgian player has been drafted in the first round since Nikoloz Tskitishvili went fifth in 2002.<br><b>Article top words: </b>Bitadze Euroleague has He NBA <br>&nbsp;<br>
